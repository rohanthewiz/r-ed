# One-liner installer / upgrader for r-ed. Detects the host OS and
# architecture, downloads the matching archive from the latest GitHub
# Release, extracts the static `r-ed` binary, and drops it into
# ~/.local/bin (preferred) or /usr/local/bin. Re-running the script
# performs an upgrade — same flow, latest version.
#
# Usage:
#
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rohanthewiz/r-ed/main/install.sh | sh
#
# Override the install location:
#
#   curl -fsSL .../install.sh | INSTALL_DIR=/opt/bin sh
#
# Override the version (default is the latest GitHub Release):
#
#   curl -fsSL .../install.sh | VERSION=v0.0.13 sh
#
# Designed to run under POSIX `sh` so it works on Alpine / BusyBox /
# minimal SSH targets in addition to bash on a normal Linux box.
