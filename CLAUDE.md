# CLAUDE.md — r-ed

Project-specific guidance for Claude Code. Read this first; it captures
conventions and design decisions that aren't obvious from the code alone.

## What this project is

r-ed is an opinionated, **mouse-first** terminal code editor aimed at
SSH-into-tmux workflows. It looks and behaves like a tiny VS Code: file
tree on the left, tabs across the top, syntax-highlighted editor in the
middle, status bar at the bottom. It ships as a single static Go binary
with no CGO.

Users open the action menu (Save, Quit, Show/Hide Sidebar, …) by clicking
the `≡` icon, right-clicking, or double-tapping `Esc`. There are
intentionally **no `Ctrl+` shortcuts** for editor actions — they conflict
with `tmux` and terminal emulators. Don't add them back.

**Every file action also lives in the main ≡ menu.** macOS Terminal +
tmux often swallows Button3 (right-click), so the editor cannot rely on
right-click as the only path to anything. Tree right-click is a redundant
shortcut, not a primary surface — when adding new file-management
features, make sure they're reachable from the main menu first.

## Module / repo

- Module: `github.com/rohanthewiz/r-ed`
- Binary name: `r-ed` (one word, lowercase — Makefile, goreleaser,
  brew formula all assume this)
- Brew tap: this same repo, `Formula/` directory (no separate tap repo)

## Architecture map

```
main.go                       Entry — parses optional rootDir arg
internal/app/app.go           Event loop, layout, menu modal, splitter, all rendering
internal/editor/buffer.go     Position + Buffer ([]string lines), edit primitives
internal/editor/tab.go        Tab: path, buffer, cursor, anchor, scroll, dirty state
internal/editor/highlight.go  Chroma → []tcell.Style per line
internal/editor/decoration.go Span/GutterMark overlay system merged in Tab.Render
internal/filetree/filetree.go Lazy tree, identity-preserving refresh, hit-test, render
internal/clipboard/clipboard.go OSC 52 to /dev/tty with tmux passthrough wrap
internal/userconfig/userconfig.go ~/.config/r-ed/config.json loader (icons mode)
internal/icons/icons.go       Nerd Font detection + per-file glyph mapping
internal/theme/theme.go       Tokyo Night palette + syntax color mapping
internal/version/version.go   const Version = "x.y.z" — single line, CI bumps it
```

## Conventions

### File headers
Every new source file gets the header block (file name, author, created
date, copyright year). See existing files for the exact format. Keep
copyright year matching the **current year** (2026 right now).

### Comments
- A short doc comment above every function (public **and** private)
  explaining intent. This is a project-wide convention — don't skip it.
- Skip throwaway "what" comments inside functions; favor "why" notes
  for non-obvious decisions.

### Tests — required, not optional
**Every source file gets a corresponding `_test.go` file in the same
package.** New code without tests should not be merged. The bar:

- New exported functions: cover happy path + the obvious failure mode.
- New unexported helpers with non-trivial logic: same.
- Bug fixes: add a test that fails before the fix and passes after.
- Pure data / glue (theme palettes, single-constant files): a smoke
  test that the value is sensible is enough.

Conventions:
- One `_test.go` per source file, in the same package (NOT `_test`),
  so tests can poke unexported helpers directly. Don't split tests
  for one source file across multiple test files.
- Each `Test*` function gets a short doc comment above it explaining
  the behavior it pins down — the same "why over what" rule as
  production code. See `internal/app/fileops_test.go` for the style.
- Use `t.TempDir()` for filesystem state; never write into the repo
  or `/tmp` directly.
- For UI / drawing code that takes a `tcell.Screen`, build one with
  `tcell.NewSimulationScreen("UTF-8")` and assert against
  `scr.GetContents()`.
- Skip a test (`t.Skip`) only when the environment can't satisfy a
  hard requirement (e.g. `/dev/tty` in CI). Don't skip to dodge a
  flaky test — fix it.

Run them locally:
```sh
make test          # go test ./... with race detector
make coverage      # generates coverage.out + an HTML report
```

CI (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) runs `go test ./...` on every push
and every PR; broken tests block merges via the PR's required-checks.

### Commits
- No "Generated with Claude Code" trailers, no Co-Authored-By Claude.
- Don't ask for commit-message approval — commit directly with a good
  message when the user asks you to commit.

## Design patterns to preserve

### `cursorMoved` flag (tab.go)
The cursor only triggers `EnsureVisible` when something actually moved
the cursor. Every cursor mutator sets `t.cursorMoved = true`; `Render`
consumes the flag and clears it. **Do not** call `EnsureVisible`
unconditionally — that re-introduces the "scroll yanks back to cursor
on every tick" bug.

### Scroll clamping with overscroll
`tab.clampScroll(viewH)` allows the last line to scroll roughly to the
middle (`overscroll = max(viewH/2, 3)`). This is intentional — without
it, you can't comfortably read the bottom of a file.

### Custom tcell events for goroutine → main-loop messaging
Background work (auto-scroll during drag, 10s tree refresh) posts custom
events (`autoScrollEvent`, `treeRefreshEvent`) onto the tcell event queue
and the main loop handles them. Don't mutate UI state from goroutines
directly.

### Identity-preserving tree refresh (filetree.go)
`reload` walks the existing children, matches survivors by name, and
keeps their `*Node` pointers (and their `Expanded` state). New entries
get fresh nodes; gone entries are dropped. This is what makes the
10-second auto-refresh feel non-jarring — open folders stay open.

### Decoration layer (editor/decoration.go)
Any "paint something over the code" feature is a `DecorationSource`
producing `Span`s (range + `StyleDelta`) and `GutterMark`s — never a
new branch inside `Tab.Render`'s paint loop. External sources register
via `Tab.DecoSources`; built-ins (selection, find) run last so merge
precedence is: syntax < external annotations < selection < find. The
gutter mark column is the single cell at `x + gutterWidth`, between
the line numbers and the code.

### Three-way external-change reconciliation (app.go)
On each tree-refresh tick, `reconcileOpenTabsWithDisk` checks each open
tab's mtime: clean buffer + changed file → silent reload; dirty buffer
+ changed file → warning; file deleted → set `DiskGone` once.

### Single-slot modal interface (modal.go)
Every secondary overlay (prompt, confirm, dirty-close, form, tree
context, finder) is a struct implementing the `modal` interface
(`handleKey` / `handleMouse` / `draw`) held in the single `App.modal`
slot — nil means none. `openModal` enforces mutual exclusivity. When
adding a modal: implement the interface, compute button geometry in ONE
method returning `btnRect`s that both draw and mouse hit-testing
consume, and reuse `textField` for any single-line input. Do NOT add
per-modal fields back onto App or new branches to handleKey/handleMouse.
After any workspace mutation call `a.workspaceChanged()` — never the
individual tree/git/finder refreshes.

### Modal layout via `relY` and dynamic `labelFor`
The action menu uses named struct literals with an optional `labelFor`
hook so labels like "Show Sidebar" / "Hide Sidebar" toggle in place.
Dividers are drawn at fixed `relY` offsets — when adding a menu item,
update those offsets and `modalHeight`.

### Sidebar splitter drag
A drag is detected when a press lands at exactly `x == splitterX()`.
Min widths: `minSidebarWidth = 18`, `minEditorAfterDrag = 40`. Don't
let the editor shrink below that.

## Build / run

```sh
make run          # go run . in current dir
make build        # build to ./bin/r-ed
make build-linux  # cross-compile linux/amd64
make install      # go install to $GOPATH/bin
make tidy         # go mod tidy
make clean        # rm -rf bin
```

There's no `dev server` to run for this project — it's a TUI. To test
UI behavior, build and run it against a real directory.

## Releases (don't break this)

Pushes to `main` trigger `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

1. Reads `internal/version/version.go`.
2. **If that file was edited in the pushed commit**, the version is used
   as-is (manual major/minor bump). **Otherwise** the patch is
   auto-bumped, committed back to main with `[skip ci]`, and pushed.
3. Tags `v<x.y.z>`.
4. GoReleaser cross-compiles, attaches archives to a GitHub Release,
   and writes `Formula/r-ed.rb` back into this repo (using the
   default `GITHUB_TOKEN` — no PAT). The formula commit also carries
   `[skip ci]` to break the loop.

If you're touching the workflow or `.goreleaser.yml`, make sure both
auto-commits keep their `[skip ci]` markers — without them the workflow
loops forever.

## What NOT to add

- `Ctrl+` editor shortcuts (they fight tmux/terminals — that's the
  whole reason the action menu exists).
- A config file / dotfile / plugin system. r-ed is opinionated.
- CGO dependencies. The whole point is one static binary.
- Tree-sitter. We use Chroma intentionally — pure Go, no setup.
- A separate `homebrew-tap` repo. The formula lives here under
  `Formula/` and that's deliberate.
